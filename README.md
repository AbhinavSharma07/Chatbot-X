Welcome to the RAW-Chatbot repository! This Python program simulates a simple text-based chatbot capable of engaging in conversations with users. It utilizes natural language processing techniques to understand user inputs and provide relevant responses.

## Features

- Incorporates greetings and knowledge base for context-aware conversations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `nltk` and `scikit-learn`. You can install them using the command: `pip install nltk scikit-learn`.
3. Customize the `corpus`, `random_responses`, `knowledge_base`, and `greetings` lists to match the topics and interactions you want your chatbot to have.
4. Run the `chatbot.py` script using your preferred Python interpreter.

## Usage...
